Description: This package provides an interface to perform cluster analysis
    on a corpus of text. Interfaces to Quanteda to assemble text corpuses easily.
    Deviationalizes text vectors prior to clustering using technique described
    by Sherin (2013). Uses cosine similarity as distance metric for two stage
    clustering process, involving Ward's algorithm hierarchical agglomerative
    clustering, and k-means clustering. Selects optimal number of clusters to
    maximize "variance explained" by clusters, adjusted by the number of clusters.
    Provides plotted output of clustering results as well as printed output.
    Assesses "model fit" of clustering solution to a set of preexisting groups in
    dataset.
